# Your Life is Currency

## Literally about money

 - Accountant/Tax lawyer simulator similar to Papers Please

## As a game mechanic

 - A puzzler (like a point-and-click) where you have to pay your way cleverly out
   of situations using a limited amount of life

## Pun on currents-sea

## As in "In Vogue"

## Electrical Engineer Simulator

Zachtronics-style???
